* Compatible with Maxwell Render 3 version 3.2.1.3+ and Blender 2.77a+ < 2.80
* UI as close to Maxwell Studio as possible
* All renderable geometry (except Metaballs)
* Object hierarchy (not renderable objects are removed unless they have renderable child objects)
* Mesh objects using the same mesh data (and renderable Curves) are exported as instances (optional)
* MXS references with viewport preview
* Dupli verts, faces and group
* Multiple UV channels
* Custom and Extension Material creation and editing inside Blender or with Mxed
* Save and load Custom and Extension Materials from or to Blender material editor
* Material assignment (including backface materials) and multiple materials per object
* Extension Materials creation and editing inside Blender
* Maxwell procedural textures
* Material preview rendering
* Viewport rendering (not interactive)
* Cameras
* Render parameters
* All render channels including Custom Alphas
* Environment parameters (Sun can be optionally set by Sun lamp)
* Object parameters
* Export objects and cameras for movement and deformation blur
* Maxwell Extensions: Particles, Grass, Hair, Scatter, Subdivision, Sea, Cloner, Volumetrics

### addon installation - Mac OS X:

* Maxwell must be installed in usual place i.e. ```/Applications/Maxwell 3```
* Download python 3.5.1 from [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/) and install
* Download this repository clicking 'Download ZIP', extract, rename directory to ```blendmaxwell``` and put to ```~/Library/Application Support/Blender/*BLENDER_VERSION*/scripts/addons/```
* Start Blender, go to User Preferences > Add-ons, search for 'blendmaxwell' in Render category and enable it, then choose 'Maxwell Render' from render engines list in Info panel header

### addon installation - Windows:

* Download this repository clicking 'Download ZIP', extract, rename directory to ```blendmaxwell``` and put to ```C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\*BLENDER_VERSION*\scripts\addons\```
* Start Blender, go to User Preferences > Add-ons, search for 'blendmaxwell' in Render category and enable it, then choose 'Maxwell Render' from render engines list in Info panel header

### addon installation - Linux:

* Append this ```export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MAXWELL3_ROOT:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH``` to your .bashrc after generated stuff from Maxwell installation, i.e. after ```MAXWELL3_ROOT``` is exported
* To fix complains of some extensions, install ```libtbb-dev```, but this step might be optional, it is used by extension not supported in addon
* Download this repository clicking 'Download ZIP', extract, rename directory to ```blendmaxwell``` and put to ```~/.config/blender/*BLENDER_VERSION*/scripts/addons/```
* Start Blender from terminal, go to User Preferences > Add-ons, search for 'blendmaxwell' in Render category and enable it, then choose 'Maxwell Render' from render engines list in Info panel header

#### installation notes:

* In case of problem with presets (emitters, extension materials, ..., ), remove on **Mac OS X**: ```~/Library/Application Support/Blender/*BLENDER_VERSION*/scripts/presets/blendmaxwell```, on **Windows**: ```C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\*BLENDER_VERSION*\scripts\presets\blendmaxwell```, or on **Linux**: ```~/.config/blender/*BLENDER_VERSION*/scripts/presets/blendmaxwell``` and restart Blender. default presets will be recreated automatically.

#### known issues:
* Due to changes in Blender's triangulation operator, Maxwell Subdivision modifier is disabled.
